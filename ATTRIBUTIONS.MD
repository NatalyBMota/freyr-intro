It is in the rock-unlimited-motivation-background-vlog-music-158250-license.txt file.
- The image in the banner underneath the main navigation is a royalty free stock photo that is also from Pixabay. It is also licensed for free use, provided that modifications are made to it. I modified it using the GIMP image editing software by adding two blurs to it. Then, further modified how it displays in the web-page by adding a text overlay to it, with a translucent background between it and the picture; as well as by using CSS code to crop it and to desaturate it ever so slighty, by decreasing the amount of colors in it, and thereby getting it a tiny bit closer to a gray scale.
